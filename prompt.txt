write a python class that loops through a folder of images and compute the coordinates of a patch and store the filename and the coordinates in a csv file. the image is an hyperspectral image from EnMAP stored in a TIF format. use gdal to open the file and use pandas to open and write to the csv file. The patches could be overlapping. I want to also skip a patch that has any pixel value equal to 0. Finally, write a pytorch dataloader that reads the csv file generated from above and returns a patch.
